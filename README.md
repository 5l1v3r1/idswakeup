IDSwakeup is a  collection of tools  that allows to test  network intrusion
detection systems.

The main  goal of  IDSwakeup is  to generate false  attack that  mimic well
known  ones, in  order to  see  if NIDS  detects them  and generates  false
positives.

Like  nidsbench  (http://www.anzen.com/research/nidsbench/),  IDSwakeup  is
being published in the hopes that  a more precise testing methodology might
be applied  to network intrusion detection, which is *still* a black art at
best.
