IDSwakeup
Stephane Aubert <Stephane.Aubert@hsc.fr>


IDSwakeup is a  collection of tools  that allows to test  network intrusion
detection systems.

The main  goal of  IDSwakeup is  to generate false  attack that  mimic well
known  ones, in  order to  see  if NIDS  detects them  and generates  false
positives.

Like  nidsbench  (http://www.anzen.com/research/nidsbench/),  IDSwakeup  is
being published in the hopes that  a more precise testing methodology might
be applied  to network intrusion detection, which is *still* a black art at
best.

This release of IDSwakeup includes:

  . IDSwakeup

    The main  shell script that permits  to launch hping2 or  iwu. The user
    just has  to choose which  attack or set of attacks  he or she  want to
    mimic. The user  can also fix the  ttl to produce short  ttl and impact
    only NIDS and not the servers.

    Usage: ./IDSwakeup <src addr> <dst addr> [nb] [ttl]

    IDSwakeup needs hping2 (http://www.kyuzz.org/antirez/hping/).

  . iwu

    Send a  buffer as a datagram.  It allows to change  the source address,
    the destination  address, the ttl (in  order to produce short  TTL). It
    also takes as parameter  the number of times the user wants to send the
    same datagram.

    Usage: ./iwu <srcIP>  <dstIP>  <nb> <ttl> <ip-datagram>

    Example: ./iwu 10.0.0.1 20.0.0.2 200  4  \
             "4500 0018 00f2 0003 4011 73db 0101 0101 0202 0202 e63e 4494"

    iwu needs libnet 1.x (http://www.packetfactory.net/Projects/Libnet/).
